      <h2>About MGNREGA Dashboard</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)</strong> 
        aims to enhance livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least 
        100 days of wage employment to every household whose adult members volunteer 
        to do unskilled manual work.
      </p>

      <p>
        This dashboard provides insights into state and district-level performance 
        under the MGNREGA scheme, including job creation, fund utilization, and 
        project completion rates. It helps visualize data trends and enables 
        better transparency and accountability.
